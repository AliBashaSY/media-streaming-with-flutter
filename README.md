#Audio Recorder for RTCDataChannel
This is a sample Flutter project that demonstrates how to use Flutter Sound to record audio and send it over RTCDataChannel in real-time.
In this example, an MP3 file is played using Flutter Sound and added to the RTCPeerConnection as an audio track. The audio data is then sent over RTCDataChannel to the receiver and played using Flutter Sound.

The transmitted audio can be recorded using Flutter Sound and sent over RTCDataChannel. The received audio can also be played using the built-in AudioElement in Flutter WebRTC. This example demonstrates the integration of Flutter Sound with WebRTC and is intended to illustrate the concept. This example can be improved and modified to meet the needs of your application.
